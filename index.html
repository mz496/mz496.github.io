        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Hello and welcome; Github page for Matthew Zhu here. I think Github is really cool, so I decided to make a user page to hold all the things I'm working on. Because I also think web development and programming is really cool. Carnegie Mellon University Class of 2018. Beginner to HTML, CSS, Javascript. Some experience in Python, Java, Lua. Queue of programming languages to learn and apply: C/C++, VB, Ruby (on Rails), PHP; plus re-learning and re-applying Java, Python. Currently learning by doing! Currently excited to keep on doing so.</p>

        <p>Here are things I've been working on. May include undeveloped ideas. Fall protection required beyond this point.</p>
        <h2>"Finished"</h2>
        <ul>

        <li>
        <a href="http://mz496.github.io/mao-timers">MA&#920; Timers</a>
        <p>A set of nine stopwatch-style timers, designed for Mu Alpha Theta competitions and the special timing and alerting involved. HTML, CSS, JS.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
        <a href="files/MAO_S-Score_Calculator.py">MA&#920; S-score Calculator</a>
        <p>A script that fetches data from the Florida MA&#920; website, does some calculations, and outputs the sum of each student's (from a specified school) top three s-scores nicely. An s-score is a performance statistic that combines a student's statewide ranking and test score. Python requires the BeautifulSoup4 and numpy modules. Optional LaTeX output requires the pgfplots and fancyhdr packages.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
        <a href="files/SphericalGeometry.py">Spherical Geometry Visualization</a>
        <p>A script that makes a manipulable 3D visualization of spherical coordinates. Includes some explanations about spherical coordinates and how to use. Python requires the VPython module.</p>
        </li>

        </ul>
        <h2>In progress</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Nothing at the moment</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Deep alpha</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A cool-looking clock: because it will look cool</li>
          <li>Something having to do with a color picker: because colors</li>
          <li>HTML5 Canvas element: because canvas. much particles. much graphics. very animation. such wow. must learn.</li>
        </ul>
