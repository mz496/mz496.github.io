If I had to summarize my first two months of 2021, it's in the word "onboarding." There's plenty to do at a new job and lots of firsts in some recent musical projects: new ventures, new concepts, new plugins to play with.

One year ago, I got some really nice basic equipment, Ableton and a MIDI controller. And sooner or later, I'm going to stop calling music projects "my first real \_\_\_\_!!" Here are things I wish someone told me while starting out.

* **Learn how to use stock tools.** There's this reputation that plugins do all the hard work, especially seeing producers on YouTube pull out easily up to ten plugins in a single tutorial video. It's partly true, but it's an unproductive stereotype. No one can effectively throw on a shiny multiband parallel compressor plugin without knowing what each of those means, which requires some quality time with the basics.
  - Around fall 2019, I dove headfirst into an EDM remix project for a competition without knowing the difference between reverb and delay. I spent around 40 hours getting to a mediocre mix but hey there's nothing like a deadline to push you to learn faster ðŸ˜¬
  - A "curriculum" per se in rough order of how I'd advise learning about them: panning, gain, reverb, delay, parameter automation, equalizer, compressor, sidechain compression, limiter.
* **Hunt for at least one free sample pack.** I was always jealous of people on YouTube who start their tutorials with "and for my next trick I will pull a sample from my sample pack, link in the description!" OK, but I want to make sounds *now*, and I don't want them to sound exactly like yours, so what am I supposed to do?
  - To be clear, I think the value is mostly in watching *how* they use that sample. Do they layer it? Do they shift other things in the arrangement to make space? What kinds of effects do they use on it?
  - Starting from scratch will probably not end that well. I started out sound designing from scratch before I found samples, but I eventually swapped them out for ones I'd found. And then I swapped those out for even better samples. Sound design was a valuable exercise, but I don't plan to try again unless I'm somehow imagining something insanely specialized.
  - Recommendations: Slate Digital, Discord servers like Audius's
* **Mix with headroom.** The first DAW I used was FL Studio, which secretly puts a limiter on your master track so that you never get hard clipping. I only noticed this much later when Ableton didn't do that for me. Almost always, louder is better, so you can hear all the little details, but too loud = clipping artifacts + loss of dynamic range. Concretely, I turn the master track up to +6 dB the entire time and turn my headphone volume down accordingly so that my relative "0 dB" is really 6 dB of extra space if I want something to not have a limiter on, like vocals.
* **Stay organized.** I didn't understand the power of Ableton's groups and return tracks until I started trying to mix and master. At that point, how do I get the vocals to sidechain but not that high FX? Easy, just turn up the -- oh wait, it's doubling the sound, so I should set it to Sends Only. Or should send it to the group, then fix all the rest, and ... It ends up taking way longer than it should. I like to group things into a "bus" and then send the entire bus to an effects chain, which makes it easier to reason about "all the vocals" or "all the non-drum percussion."
* **Do a rough mix/master as you go.** By keeping levels and frequencies in check throughout the entire process, I like the certainty that a demo I bounce at any point will be fairly close to the final product. And don't forget to play it on multiple sound systems!
* **Ear fatigue is real.** Often after a day of not listening to a mix, I'll fire it up and immediately notice something I want to change but didn't notice in the 3+ hours I spent the day before getting it to a point I liked. I also find that I'm going back to old projects to revisit them after I listen again and my taste has changed.

And here are some things I still want to learn:
* **Synth patch creation.** Here's one specific area of sound design that can feature super prominently in tracks, and I have close to no experience with. I'm trying to understand the Waves Ovox plugin to see if I can get away with not actually fiddling with sine waves...
* **Mixing real instruments.** This is part wanting to learn arrangement, part wanting the immersiveness that real instruments bring. I've been trying to learn guitar to do this.
* **Live performance.** I originally got into music production by making mashups. And mashups originated with DJs who would literally have two physical records spinning at the same time. I don't think I want to go that route, but performing with live elements inspires me with some of my favorite producers. See also: Madeon, Gryffin.
