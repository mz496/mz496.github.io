This requires you to have the [Prettier plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10456-prettier/) installed. Works on my IntelliJ IDEA 2020.2.4.

Hit `âŒ˜`-`,` to open Preferences.

Navigate to Languages & Frameworks > JavaScript > Prettier.

Set your Prettier package path accordingly.

My repo has a bunch of subdirectories with different Prettier versions alongside my local installation:
