    <p class="pt-1"></p>
    <p>Roughly a 4-min read, and the tl;dr is above the line. Last updated 2025-03-21.</p>
    <p class="pt-1"></p>
    <p>Me:</p>
    <p class="pt-1"></p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="strong">Spent 6 years building products in backend languages</span> (and some frontend/data/infra) at companies of sizes from ~60 to 10K+. An artist at heart. Spikes in empathy and written communication. Working on spoken communication and really internalizing and prioritizing my primary focus at all times</li>
      <li class="pt-0">Looking for my next thing in <span class="strong">NYC in-person</span> after a recent move from SF</li>
      <li class="pt-0"><span class="strong">Making my final decision by 2025-04-22</span></li>
      <li class="pt-0">Currently talking broadly to mostly small, AI-native tech companies and a few larger private tech companies. Not attached to a single problem space but always looking to make the most of my particular skills to have an outsized positive impact on the world</li>
      <li class="pt-0">Tools I'm immediately productive in = {backend: [Scala, Java, Python, Go], frontend: [TypeScript, React], data: [Postgres, Databricks, Airflow], infra: [Kubernetes]}. Fiddled with lots of others that I've never finished a <a href="/projects">substantial project</a> with</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="pt-1"></p>
    <p>You:</p>
    <p class="pt-1"></p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="strong">Connect with people and not resumes/skillsets.</span> The last few years threw you for a loop, and AI simultaneously saddens you and gives you hope for the resurgence of human connection</li>
      <li class="pt-0">Working with a team composed of people with a bit of a creative silly streak, who want something out of their lives and move with purpose and urgency to figure that out and make that happen</li>
      <li class="pt-0">Know of anything that fits my arbitrary personal criteria below :) <a href="https://npme9g67d94.typeform.com/to/zFb7ommX">Reach out if so!</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p class="py-1"></p>

    <p class="fg4">==================================================================</p>

    <p class="py-1"></p>

    <p class="text heading-3 fg0">What I'm looking for (long version)</p>
    <p class="pt-1"></p>
    <p>Note:</p>
    <p class="pt-1"></p>
    <ul>
      <li>I've mostly phrased these criteria to be relevant to working groups of &lt;100 people, although I could imagine some of these traits in a person even in larger groups.</li>
      <li class="pt-0">If this sounds too hardline, I‚Äôm not actually that intense of a person, I promise! I blame late-stage capitalism and existential dread for most of the ‚Äúno‚Äù traits, not individual people.</li>
      <li class="pt-0">I don't expect all the yes's from anyone. A mix can be okay too.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="py-1"></p>

    <p class="text heading-3 fg0">Hard yes</p>
    <p class="pt-1"></p>
    Leaders have traits or skills that I strive to have. These immediately get my attention.
    <p class="pt-1"></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Founders with <span class="strong">warm, infectious energy</span> filling up the room when they talk about the problem they‚Äôre solving, which is way too complex/annoying for most people to even want to approach, but they clearly shine when asked about it</li>
      <li class="pt-0"><span class="strong">Strong understanding of how to build things people want</span>, initially borne out of lots of conversations. Have prospects and specific ideal users in mind before there‚Äôs a concrete version (need not be directly interested yet). See a healthy number of buyers show strong inbound intent to pay once there‚Äôs a concrete version. See a healthy number of excited paying power users give feedback once there‚Äôs an integrated version</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="py-1"></p>

    <p class="text heading-3 fg0">Soft yes</p>
    <p class="pt-1"></p>
    Not enough individually to sway me to join, but very nice to have.
    <p class="pt-1"></p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="strong">Repeat founders</span> who have sold their businesses in the past, played a large generalist part in scaling up from early stage, or played a large generalist part in something very ambitious and successful (by some measure) in the past</li>
      <li class="pt-0"><span class="strong">In-office NYC presence</span></li>
      <li class="pt-0">Testing a hypothesis at all times at <span class="strong">high iteration speed</span> in service of a shared focus/north star</li>
      <li class="pt-0"><span class="strong">People who are interested in the nitty-gritty company internals/happenings,</span> and founders who accordingly recognize and invest in knowledge- and context-sharing of those as a process for maintaining motivation that can be inefficient and can be improved</li>
      <li class="pt-0"><span class="strong">Strong focus on resisting the pull of gravity</span> toward a mediocre outcome, team, and energy level</li>
      <li class="pt-0">Founders who have <span class="strong">experience leading teams larger than the one they have now</span> for at least a year</li>
      <li class="pt-0">A technical team that <span class="strong">intentionally seeks diversity.</span> I think positive effects increase exponentially up to around 30% representation (or, 0 &lt; 1 &lt;&lt; 2 &lt;&lt;&lt; 3 people of an underrepresented background, whichever is larger in a daily practical context)</li>
      <li class="pt-0">Leaders who motivate people by example, solve problems, are unusually warm and kind, give specific actionable timely feedback, and want to <span class="strong">invest in and grow their people</span></li>

    </ul>

    <p class="py-1"></p>

    <p class="text heading-3 fg0">Soft no</p>
    <p class="pt-1"></p>
    Warning signs of an environment where I might end up being so fatigued and disengaged that I leave much earlier than I'd like.
    <p class="pt-1"></p>
    <ul>
      <li>All founders are non-technical</li>
      <li class="pt-0">Technical founders or eng teams saying things like ‚Äúnot sure, I‚Äôm just an engineer‚Äù when asked questions about the business performance and strategy</li>
      <li class="pt-0">Founders who do not set clear guidelines for norms and behaviors that they consciously incentivize and disincentivize, and then actually follow them. A strong policy that I disagree with is still much better than a weak or inconsistent one</li>
      <li class="pt-0">Early over-specialization (and no path to changing) of roles and team boundaries like ‚Äúfrontend engineer.‚Äù This is fine during hiring in order to quickly communicate skillsets/areas that need help, but I expect some fluidity and interest in doing whatever it takes to solve problems internally</li>
      <li class="pt-0">Team members emphasize pizza parties and happy hours and their great work-life balance as ‚Äúculture.‚Äù I do hope we have a measured amount of things like that, just not an emphasis on them. Also, I don't think of this as culture</li>
      <li class="pt-0">Company existed before 2023 and references AI, but I can‚Äôt immediately answer no to ‚Äúis this company just shoehorning in AI because they‚Äôre afraid no one will take them seriously otherwise?‚Äù</li>
      <li class="pt-0">It would be difficult to greenlight using AI for daily workflows (like Claude, Cursor, etc.) for any reason</li>
      <li class="pt-0">The company has a referral bonus incentive of more than $1K</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="py-1"></p>

    <p class="text heading-3 fg0">Hard no</p>
    <p class="pt-1"></p>
    I'm immediately ending the conversation, or never starting it. But not ghosting; I'm not a savage.
    <p class="pt-1"></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Founders who consistently make morally bad judgements or choices</li>
      <li class="pt-0">‚ÄúYC is a rite of passage‚Äù</li>
      <li class="pt-0">‚ÄúI look around and see people around me founding stuff and think I need to do that too as my life‚Äôs work‚Äù</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="py-1"></p>
