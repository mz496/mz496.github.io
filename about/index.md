# …this blog:

This space is mostly to share stories and exciting things I've seen and learned. I want to take advantage of my two favorite things about the internet: maintaining easily accessible records and fostering connections in a world where physical distance doesn't matter as much anymore. I don't plan to limit it to software or any particular area, so let's see where it goes!

To that end, I'd love to chat on [Twitter!](https://twitter.com/mz496_)

# …me:
Software engineer by trade ([LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/mz496)). Sometimes building more software on the side ([GitHub](https://github.com/mz496)), sometimes making instrumental covers of pop songs ([YouTube](https://youtube.com/c/mattzhu)), sometimes producing music ([SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/blueticksound)), sometimes doodling on a whim ([Instagram](https://instagram.com/mz496)), sometimes reading ([Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/125473298-matthew-zhu)). Occasionally social gaming, watching thrillers, traveling, making physical gadgets and trinkets. I like trying to understand as many perspectives as possible.
